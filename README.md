My Portfolios
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository is a curated collection of my web development projects, organized by technology and complexity. Here, you'll find a range of applications showcasing my skills in frontend, backend, and 3D web development.
Repository Structure
This repository is organized into three main categories, each containing multiple projects:
 * html_css_js_portfolios/: This folder houses projects primarily built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These demonstrate my foundational web development skills, including responsive design, interactive elements, and modern CSS techniques.
 * full_stack_portfolios/: Here, you'll find my full-stack applications. These projects showcase my ability to work with both frontend and backend technologies, often involving databases, server-side logic, and API integrations.
 * 3d_portfolios/: This section is dedicated to my projects that incorporate 3D elements and visualizations. These portfolios highlight my experience with libraries and frameworks like Three.js, Babylon.js, or other related technologies for creating immersive web experiences.
